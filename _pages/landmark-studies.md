2. Scholars & Mentors Who Inspire Me

My research is shaped by scholars whose work has influenced how economists
and social scientists think about behavioral frictions, urban environments,
and credible causal inference. I am especially inspired by researchers who
connect rigorous empirical methods with deep questions about decision-making,
institutions, and inequality.

- **Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky** — for foundational insights on salience,
  loss aversion, and how individuals perceive risk and uncertainty.

- **Sendhil Mullainathan** — for pioneering work on attention, scarcity, and
  behavioral constraints in economic life.

- **Raj Chetty** — for demonstrating how neighborhoods and institutions shape
  opportunity and long-run outcomes.

- **Judea Pearl** — for establishing the modern framework of causal reasoning
  through structural models and causal graphs, shaping how I think about
  identification and explanation.

- **Alberto Abadie** — for foundational contributions to modern causal inference
  and policy evaluation.

- **Guido Imbens** — for shaping the way economists think about identification,
  experiments, and credible empirical design.

- **Kosuke Imai** — for methodological innovation at the intersection of
  statistics, political economy, and measurement.

- **Susan Athey** — for pioneering work at the intersection of causal inference,
  machine learning, and policy evaluation, inspiring computational approaches
  to modern empirical questions.

- **Andreas Pape** — for thoughtful mentorship and guidance on combining
  computational modeling with empirical rigor.

I see my own research agenda as building on these traditions—bringing behavioral
mechanisms such as salience, memory, and social comparison into applied urban
and institutional economics.
