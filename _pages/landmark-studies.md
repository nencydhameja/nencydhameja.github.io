This page highlights a **curated selection of landmark empirical studies and causal research designs** in economics.

Rather than a comprehensive list, these studies reflect influential approaches to understanding how **institutions, environments, and information** shape economic and social outcomes.

---

## Crime, Salience, and Housing Markets  
### Linden & Rockoff (2008) — Sex Offenders and Property Values  

A canonical example of how local crime risk is capitalized into housing prices through information and salience.

- **Design:** Event-study around sex offender registry disclosures  
- **Core insight:** Housing markets respond sharply to newly salient crime information  

---

## Neighborhood Effects and Place-Based Opportunity  
### Moving to Opportunity (MTO) — Kling, Ludwig & Katz (2005)

One of the most influential demonstrations that place matters causally.

- **Design:** Randomized housing voucher experiment  
- **Core insight:** Neighborhood environments shape long-run outcomes, including safety and mobility  

---

## Institutions and Labor Market Discrimination  
### Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004) — Résumé Audit Experiment  

A watershed study in causal labor economics.

- **Design:** Randomized employer callbacks using racially distinctive names  
- **Core insight:** Institutional screening generates persistent inequities  

---

## Health Policy Evaluation at Scale  
### Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (2008–2010)

A benchmark randomized evaluation in modern health economics.

- **Design:** Medicaid expansion assigned by lottery  
- **Core insight:** Insurance affects access, financial security, and health behaviors  

---

## Food Environments and Behavioral Public Policy  
### Bollinger & Leslie (2011) — Menu Labeling and Consumer Choice  

A classic example of how salient information interventions shape health behavior.

- **Design:** Difference-in-differences around calorie labeling policy  
- **Core insight:** Consumer decisions respond strongly to visible informational cues  

---

## Modern Difference-in-Differences and Policy Timing  
### Callaway & Sant’Anna (2021) — Staggered Adoption DiD

A defining methodological advance in applied causal inference.

- **Design:** Group-time ATT framework robust to TWFE bias  
- **Core insight:** Policy adoption timing requires modern estimators for credible event studies  

---

## Computational Experiments and Market Institutions  
### Gode & Sunder (1993) — Zero-Intelligence Traders  

A foundational experiment linking market design to bounded rationality.

- **Design:** Laboratory markets with constrained random bidding  
- **Core insight:** Institutions can generate equilibrium outcomes even with simple agents

## A Common Theme  

Across these settings, a shared lesson emerges:

> Economic outcomes are shaped not only by preferences and constraints, but also by  
> **institutions, environments, and the salience of information.**
