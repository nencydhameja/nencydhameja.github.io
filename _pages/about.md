I'm Nency Dhameja, a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Binghamton University (State University of New York).

My research interests include applied econometrics,labor economics and urban economics. I apply causal inference to study the effects of policies on real-world outcomes. Iâ€™m especially interested in integrating machine learning methods into econometric and computational frameworks.
