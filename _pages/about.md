I'm Nency Dhameja (pronounced as Nancy), a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Binghamton University (State University of New York).

My research interests include applied econometrics, labor economics and computational economics. I apply causal inference to study the effects of policies on real-world outcomes. I’m especially interested in integrating machine learning methods into econometric and computational frameworks.
