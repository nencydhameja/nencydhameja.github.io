<p>I'm Nency Dhameja (pronounced <i>“Nancy”</i>), a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Binghamton University (State University of New York).</p>

<p>My research spans labor, applied micro, behavioral, and urban economics, with a methodological focus on modern causal inference. I study how behavioral frictions—such as attention, salience, identity, and risk preferences—shape real-world responses to crime, food environments, and education and labor-market policies. My current projects apply advanced causal and machine learning methods to analyze behavioral reactions to local crime in housing markets, the role of limited attention and food-access frictions in obesity, identity-driven evaluation in faculty hiring, and prospect-theory–inspired behavioral modeling using LLM and agent-based approaches.</p>

<p>Before academia, I spent over a decade in the IT industry as a Software Engineer, Tech Lead, and Project Manager at firms including Accenture, JLL, and Grab in Singapore. An Executive MBA sparked my interest in economics and ultimately led me to pursue a doctoral degree.

<p>My technical background in software engineering and workflow design strongly informs my research. It enables me to build robust and reproducible data pipelines, conduct large-scale empirical analysis, and develop computational and LLM-based agent models for studying economic behavior and policy evaluation.</p>
