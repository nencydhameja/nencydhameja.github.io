<p>I'm Nency Dhameja (pronounced <i>“Nancy”</i>), a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Binghamton University (State University of New York).</p>
<p>
My research is centered on causal inference and policy evaluation in applied microeconomics. I study how institutions and local environments shape economic, labor-market, and health outcomes, using modern quasi-experimental methods including difference-in-differences, reweighting and confounding adjustment, and machine learning–augmented causal designs.</p>
<p>
Before academia, I spent over a decade in the IT industry as a Software Engineer, Tech Lead, and Project Manager at firms including Accenture, JLL, and Grab in Singapore. This technical background informs my work through an emphasis on reproducible pipelines, large-scale administrative data, and computational models (including LLM-based agent simulations) for studying economic behavior and policy interventions.

<!-- <p>My research spans labor, applied micro, behavioral, and urban economics, with a strong focus on causal inference.
Before academia, I spent over a decade in the IT industry as a Software Engineer, Tech Lead, and Project Manager at firms including Accenture, JLL, and Grab in Singapore. An Executive MBA sparked my interest in economics and ultimately led me to pursue a doctoral degree.</p>

<p>My technical background in software engineering and workflow design strongly informs my research. It enables me to build robust and reproducible data pipelines, conduct large-scale empirical analysis, and develop computational and LLM-based agent models for studying economic behavior and policy evaluation.</p> -->

<!-- My current projects examine behavioral reactions to neighborhood crime in housing markets, frictions in food environments, identity-driven evaluation in faculty hiring, and dynamic risk-taking modeled through prospect theory.</p> -->
