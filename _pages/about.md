I'm Nency Dhameja (pronounced as Nancy), a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Binghamton University (State University of New York).

My research interests include applied econometrics, labor economics and computational economics. I apply causal inference to study the effect of policies on real-world outcomes. I’m especially interested in integrating machine learning methods into econometric and computational frameworks.

Before academia, I spent over a decade in the IT industry, working as a Software Engineer, Tech Lead, and Project Manager at Accenture, JLL, and Grab. My experience building software systems, managing data workflows, and leading technical teams now directly informs my research. It enables me to construct reproducible data pipelines, and develop computational and LLM-based agent models for economic analysis.
