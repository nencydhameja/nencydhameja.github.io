<p>I'm Nency Dhameja (pronounced <i>“Nancy”</i>), a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Binghamton University (State University of New York).</p>

<p>My research spans labor, applied micro, behavioral, and urban economics, with a strong focus on causal inference. My current projects examine behavioral reactions to neighborhood crime in housing markets, limited-attention frictions in food environments and obesity, identity-driven evaluation in faculty hiring, and dynamic risk-taking modeled through prospect theory.</p>

<p>Before academia, I spent over a decade in the IT industry as a Software Engineer, Tech Lead, and Project Manager at firms including Accenture, JLL, and Grab in Singapore. An Executive MBA sparked my interest in economics and ultimately led me to pursue a doctoral degree.

<p>My technical background in software engineering and workflow design strongly informs my research. It enables me to build robust and reproducible data pipelines, conduct large-scale empirical analysis, and develop computational and LLM-based agent models for studying economic behavior and policy evaluation.</p>
