## The Effect of Diversity Statements in Faculty Hiring with _David Slichter_

This project studies how mandatory diversity statements in faculty job applications shape who gets hired, how search committees evaluate candidates, and what kinds of institutions adopt these requirements.

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

This paper investigates the causal effect of diversity statements in faculty hiring on both who is hired and how institutions position themselves on diversity.

I combine faculty-level hiring data with a new hand-collected dataset on job advertisements that require diversity statements. Using variation in the timing and intensity of diversity-statement adoption across departments and institutions, I estimate how these requirements affect:

- the demographic composition of new hires,
- the distribution of hires across institution types,
- and the alignment between stated diversity goals and realized hiring outcomes.

The empirical strategy builds on difference-in-differences and event-study designs, with robustness checks using alternative comparison groups and textual measures of how committees talk about diversity. The project aims to distinguish between diversity statements as a *screening device*, a *sorting mechanism*, and a *symbolic compliance* tool, with implications for the design of equitable hiring policies in academia.

## Salience, Attention, and Memory: Crime and Property Values

*Work in progress*  

This project asks how homebuyers *perceive* and *remember* local crime risk, and how that perception is capitalized into housing prices over space and time.

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

Standard hedonic models assume that housing prices reflect local crime rates in a relatively static way. This project instead models capitalization as the outcome of **salience, attention, and memory**.

Using geocoded repeat-sales housing data matched to detailed crime incidents, I construct spatiotemporal “crime exposure” measures that vary by: distance rings around each property, time windows before sale, and decay patterns that capture how quickly buyers.
