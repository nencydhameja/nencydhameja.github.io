### Causal Inference, Applied Micro, and Behavioral Economics

#### <span class="paper-title">Salience, Attention, and Memory: Crime Capitalization in Housing Prices</span>
<span class="label label--info">Work in Progress</span> 
Homebuyers observe crime infrequently, recall it imperfectly, and often overweight unusually salient incidents. This paper studies how these behavioral frictions shape the spatial and temporal pattern of crime capitalization in housing prices.

#### **The Effect of Diversity Statements in Faculty Hiring**  
<span class="label label--primary">Working Paper</span>  
*with David Slichter*

This project examines how mandatory diversity statements in faculty job applications influence hiring and student outcomes. Using comprehensive text from JOE and APSA postings linked to institution–year–discipline hiring records, we classify DEI-related requirements and estimate their effects using modern staggered-adoption DiD estimators with entropy-balancing weights.

#### **Food Swamps, Obesity, and Metabolic Risks**  
<span class="label label--info">Work in Progress</span>
This project examines how the expansion of dollar stores and low-nutrition retail environments contributes to obesity, metabolic disorders, and long-run health risks. Using store rollouts and quasi-experimental variation in food environments, I study how changes in access to calorie-dense, nutrient-poor options affect chronic disease outcomes.
**Fields:** Health Economics, Urban Economics, Public Economics  
**Methods:** Event Studies / DiD

### Computational Economics, Agent-Based Models, and LLMs

#### **Monte Carlo Diagnostics for Agent-Based Models**  
<span class="label label--primary">Working Paper</span>  
*with Christopher Zosh, Yixin Ren, Andreas Pape*

We develop a statistical framework for diagnosing parameter identifiability and uncertainty in stochastic agent-based models (ABMs). The approach combines Monte Carlo experiments with simulation-based confidence intervals, providing generalizable tools for calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis in complex ABMs.

**Fields:** Computational Economics, Econometrics, Simulation  
**Methods:** Agent-Based Models, Monte Carlo Simulation, Simulation-Based Inference

#### **Social Context in the Schelling Model Using LLMs**  
<span class="label label--primary">Working Paper</span>  
*with Andreas Pape, Srikanth Iyer, Carl Lipo, Yixin Ren, Christopher Zosh*

This paper introduces large language models as agents in the classic Schelling segregation model to study how communication, narrative framing, and social context shape emergent spatial patterns. Embedding linguistic reasoning into spatial decision rules produces segregation outcomes that differ systematically from traditional models, highlighting how richer cognitive processes alter neighborhood sorting.

**Fields:** Computational Economics, Behavioral Economics, Social Dynamics  
**Methods:** Agent-Based Models, Large Language Models, Experimental Simulation
