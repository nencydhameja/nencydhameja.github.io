## Causal Inference, Applied Micro, and Behavioral Economics
### <span class="paper-title">Salience, Attention, and Memory: Crime Capitalization in Housing Prices</span> _(Work in Progress)_

Homebuyers observe crime infrequently, recall it imperfectly, and often overweight unusually salient incidents. This paper studies how these behavioral frictions shape the spatial and temporal pattern of crime capitalization in housing prices. Using detailed incident-level crime data linked to repeat-sales transactions, I develop a flexible space–time kernel estimator that recovers the distance-decay and time-decay of crime’s price impact.

**Fields:** Urban Economics, Behavioral Economics, Housing Markets  
**Methods:** Spatial–Temporal Kernel Estimation, Repeat-Sales Models, Administrative Data  

### <span class="paper-title">The Effect of Diversity Statements in Faculty Hiring</span> <i>with David Slichter (Working Paper)</i>

This project examines how mandatory diversity statements in faculty job applications influence hiring and student outcomes. Using comprehensive text from JOE and APSA postings linked to institution–year–discipline hiring records, we classify DEI-related requirements and estimate their effects using staggered-adoption DiD estimators with entropy-balancing weights.

**Fields:** Labor & Personnel Economics, Higher Education, Applied Microeconomics  
**Methods:** Difference-in-Differences (csdid), Entropy Balancing, Text Classification  

### <span class="paper-title">Food Swamps, Obesity, and Metabolic Risks</span> _(Work in Progress)_

This project examines how the expansion of dollar stores and low-nutrition retail environments contributes to obesity/metabolic health risks. Using store rollouts and quasi-experimental variation in food environments, I study how changes in access to calorie-dense, nutrient-poor options affect chronic disease outcomes.

**Fields:** Health Economics, Urban Economics, Public Economics  
**Methods:** Event Studies / DiD  

## Computational Economics, Agent-Based Models, and LLMs
### <span class="paper-title">Monte Carlo Diagnostics for Agent-Based Models</span> <i>with Christopher Zosh, Yixin Ren, Andreas Pape (Working Paper)</i>

We develop a statistical framework for diagnosing parameter identifiability and uncertainty in stochastic agent-based models (ABMs). The approach combines Monte Carlo experiments with simulation-based confidence intervals, providing generalizable tools for calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis in complex ABMs.

**Fields:** Computational Economics, Econometrics, Simulation  
**Methods:** Agent-Based Models, Monte Carlo Simulation, Simulation-Based Inference

### <span class="paper-title">Social Context in the Schelling Model Using LLMs</span> <i>with Andreas Pape, Srikanth Iyer, Carl Lipo, Yixin Ren, Christopher Zosh (Working Paper) </i>
This paper introduces large language models as agents in the classic Schelling segregation model to study how communication, narrative framing, and social context shape emergent spatial patterns.

**Fields:** Computational Economics, Behavioral Economics, Social Dynamics  
**Methods:** Agent-Based Models, Large Language Models, Experimental Simulation
